# miracle-wm

miracle-wm is a Wayland compositor based on [Mir](https://github.com/MirServer/mir). It features a tiling window manager at its core, very much in the style of [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway). The intention is to build a compositor that is flashier and more feature-rich than either of those compositors, like [swayfx](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx).

See the [installation guide](getting_started/installation.md) for installation instructions on your platform.

!!! note
    If none of this makes any sense to you or you're new to Wayland or Linux, check out the [What is a Wayland compositor?](getting_started/what_is_a_wayland_compositor.md) document for a structured walk through the entire ecosystem.
