# Introduction
Miracle is configured via a `YAML` file. This section describes the settings that you may define in that file.

## File location
The configuration file will be written blank the first time that you start the compositor. The file is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/miracle-wm.yaml`. It is written on the initial startup of `miracle` if it does not yet exist. The most likely location is:

```
~/.config/miracle-wm.yaml.
```

!!! note
    See the [arch user guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory) for information about `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
